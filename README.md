## 📈 Insights

1. India recorded the highest number of total COVID-19 cases among the selected countries, followed by the United States.

2. Kenya's vaccination rollout started later compared to the U.S. and India, and the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals remained lower.

3. Death rates were relatively stable across countries but showed spikes during major COVID waves (e.g., Delta variant period).

4. New daily cases peaked at different times across countries, indicating different waves and containment effectiveness.

5. The U.S. achieved rapid early vaccination but plateaued in recent months, while India had a slower start with steady growth.
